Ingredients:
	4-5 medium-sized potatoes
	4-6 large eggs
	Olive oil
	Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions:

	Peel the potatoes and slice them into thin rounds, about 1/8-inch thick.

	Heat a generous amount of olive oil in a non-stick frying pan over medium heat.

	Add the potato slices to the hot oil, making sure they are well-covered in oil. Fry the potatoes until they are tender and lightly golden brown. Be sure to stir occasionally to ensure even cooking. This may take around 15-20 minutes.

	Once the potatoes are cooked, remove them from the pan using a slotted spoon to drain excess oil. Place them in a bowl and allow them to cool slightly.

	In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and season them with salt and pepper.

	Add the fried potatoes to the beaten eggs and mix them together, ensuring that the potatoes are well-coated with the egg mixture.

	Heat a small amount of olive oil in the same pan over medium heat.

	Pour the potato and egg mixture into the pan, spreading it out evenly. Reduce the heat to low.

	Cook the tortilla for about 5-7 minutes on one side until it starts to set.

	To flip the tortilla, place a large plate over the pan and carefully invert the tortilla onto the plate.

	Slide the tortilla back into the pan to cook the other side for an additional 5-7 minutes or until it's fully set and slightly golden brown.

	Once the tortilla is cooked through and has a nice golden color on both sides, remove it from the pan and let it cool for a few minutes.

	Cut the tortilla into slices or wedges and serve. You can enjoy it warm or at room temperature.
